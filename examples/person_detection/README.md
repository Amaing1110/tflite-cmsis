# Person detection example

This example shows how you can use Tensorflow Lite to run a 250 kilobyte neural
network to recognize people in images.

## Run the tests on a SF32LB52X board

```
* cd examples/dtln/project
* scons --board=sf32lb52-lcd_n16r8
* .\build_sf32lb52-lcd_n16r8_hcpu\uart_download.bat
```
